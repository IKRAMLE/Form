A full-stack web application that allows users to submit information through a structured form. The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (DOM manipulation), provides a responsive and user-friendly interface for input fields, validation, and submission handling. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express, processes the form submissions and interacts with MongoDB via Mongoose to store the submitted data. The app ensures seamless communication between the frontend and backend using fetch API for handling form submissions via API endpoints. This setup makes it efficient for collecting and managing user data securely.
